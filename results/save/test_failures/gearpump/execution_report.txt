GLOSSARY
------

p_fail:
  Estimated failure risk. Higher = more likely to fail.

Fuzzy decision:
  AI-based analysis choosing best recovery action.
  Score (0-100) and confidence (%) indicate decision quality.

Actions:
  - change_tool: Switch to alternative tool
  - bypass: Skip inaccessible component
  - destroy: Remove component by destruction
  - replan: Recalculate sequence after changes

States:
  - done: Successfully removed components
  - destroyed: Components removed by destruction
  - locked: Components physically blocked (not removable)
  - skipped: Components bypassed (not on current path)
